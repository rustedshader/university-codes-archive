# Problem: Guess no between 1 to 50 guess number.

- Problem is design for a particular/specific task.
- Finite number of steps
- Step by step Instruction
- Well defined

# Algorithm

A step by step way to solve a particular problem or task such that it will solve that problem in a finite number of steps.
Further all the steps should be well defined and the algorithm is implemntable.

# Properties of Algorithm

- Finiteness
- Definiteness
- Effective
- Generality
- Zero Input or if one then one output.
- Atleast one output.
