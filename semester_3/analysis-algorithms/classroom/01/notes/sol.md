# For N = 1

Number of ways: 1

# For N = 2

1 + 1 = 2
2 = 2

Number of ways: 2

# For N = 3

1+1+1 = 3
2+1 = 3
1+2 = 3

Number of ways: 3

# For N = 4

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
1 + 1 + 2 = 4
1 + 2 + 1 = 4
2 + 1 + 1 = 4
2 + 2 = 4

Number of ways: 5

# For N = 5

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5
1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5
1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
2 + 2 + 1 = 5
2 + 1 + 2 = 5
1 + 2 + 2 = 5

Number of ways: 8

Deducing the pattern we can see that its a fibonnaci series but it starts from 3rd.
